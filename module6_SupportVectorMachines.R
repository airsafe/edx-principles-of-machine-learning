# ====================

# Support Vector Machine Models
# Support vector machines (SVMs) are a widely used and powerful category of machine learning algorithms. 
# There are many variations on the basic idea of an SVM. 
# An SVM attempts to maximally separate classes by finding the support vector with the lowest error rate or maximum separation. 
# SVMs can use many types of kernel functions. 
# The most common kernel functions are linear and the radial basis function or RBF. 
# The linear basis function attempts to separate classes by finding hyperplanes in the feature space that maximally separate classes. 
# The RBF uses set of local Gaussian shaped basis kernels to find a nonlinear separation of the classes.
# 
# Example: Iris dataset
# As a first example you will use SVMs to classify the species of iris flowers.

#         
#       1. A Caret trainControl object is used to define the 5 fold cross validation.

#          The svmRadial model does accommodate case weights. 
#          However, in the case down-sampling or under-sampling is used. 
#          Down-sampling randomly samples the majority case so that the number of classes in each training fold is balanced.
#       2. The model is trained using all features as can be seen from the model formula in the Caret train function.
#       3. ROC is specified as a metric in the call to train.
#       4. Weights are specified to help with the class imbalance and the cost imbalance of misclassification of bad credit customers.
#       5. The train function uses a tuneGrid argument to define the hyperparameters to search.

# Execute this code and examine the result.

# Summary
# In this lab you have accomplished the following:
#         
#       1. Used a radial support vector machine to classify the cases of the iris data. 
#          This model produced quite good results.
#       2. Used 5 fold to find estimated optimal hyperparameters for an svmRadial model to classify credit risk cases. 
#          The model trained using ROC as the metric performed reasonably well.
#       3. Applied down-sampling of the majority cases to create a balanced training dataset and retrained and evaluated the model.
#       4. Applied feature importance was used for feature selection. 
#          The model created and evaluated with the reduced feature set had essentially the same performance as the model with more features.
#       5. Used the outer loop of the nested cross validation to demonstrate that the model is likely to generalize.
